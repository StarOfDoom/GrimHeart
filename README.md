Unity game that had a decent amount of support. My largest project to date by far. Rewrite #3.

**World of Titans** is a Free To Play, Rogue-Lite, MMO-RPG! Being a multiplayer, perma-death RPG, there is an added level of strategy and skill required which sets this game apart from others. Based in Terragi, a once beautiful, flourishing world that has since been run down by hordes of monsters, you must fight alongside your fellow warriors in order to destroy the monsters who have overrun the lands, and restore Terragi to it's beautiful state!

# Features

## Multiplayer
  Play with your friends! Meet new people! Enjoy your time collaborating in a large world filled with dungeons for everyone to conquer!

## RPG and Perma-Death
  Level up and progress your character! Conquer enemies and find better items over time. Make sure not to perish or you lose your character, as well as everything on them. However, there is storage that holds items through death!

## Free To Play
  Join and play completely free with all of your friends!  We want everyone to have a fair, equal, and most of all, fun experience! All purchasable items are purely cosmetic or have fairly small affects, leaving no players with an advantage over others.

## Dungeon Randomization
  Fight through and conquer a unique dungeon every time you play! Discover hidden loot and find out the secrets of Terragi!

## Item Randomization
  Items are also heavily randomized! Damage, fire rate, and other specific attributes are all varied by chance! Collect and trade to get best items!

## Item Attributes
  Items may have special randomized attributes, such as freezing enemies, increasing speed, increasing damage, and much more! This randomness makes each item unique, and keeps you from ever getting the same item twice!

## Classes
  Play as many classes, each with their own unique abilities! Whether you want to play as support, DPS, or anything in-between, there will be classes for anyone and everyone!

Above is just one example of what a randomized dungeon might look like. These dungeons would be populated with enemies to conquer and loot to discover!
